# TOLO Coffee Shop App

React Native coffee shop app with focus on simplicity and user experience.

## Core Features

- Menu browsing with categories
- Store location and hours
- Contact information
- Multi-language support

## Design Principles

- Clean, modern UI
- Fast performance
- Accessible design
- Consistent spacing and typography

## Technical Standards

- Use React Native Unistyles for all styling
- Lingui for all user-facing text
- TypeScript for type safety
- Follow KISS principle
- ALL files must use kebab-case naming (e.g., language-context.tsx, use-color-scheme.ts)

## AI Assistant Guidelines

- Avoid outputting verbose change summaries for each task to save tokens
- Focus on implementing changes efficiently without excessive explanations
- Only provide summaries when explicitly requested by the user
- Use JSDoc comments only when necessary - avoid documenting trivial or self-explanatory functions
