# Cursor Rules for TOLO Coffee Shop App

## Package Manager
- ALWAYS use `bun` as the package manager, never npm or yarn
- Use `bun add <package>` for adding new dependencies
- Use `bun remove <package>` for removing dependencies

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions
- ALWAYS run `bun run format` after completing any task
- Implement proper error handling with Sentry integration

## Expo Updates
- Updates are configured with fingerprint runtime policy
- Always capture update errors to Sentry with proper context
- Never create UI components for update status - keep updates silent
